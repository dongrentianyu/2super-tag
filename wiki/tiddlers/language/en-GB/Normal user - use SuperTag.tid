title: language/en-GB/Normal user - use SuperTag

Some of plugins will provide SuperTag that you can already use, just add these tag to a tiddler, a form will automatically generate on the tiddler view mode.

By simply adding a SuperTag to a tiddler (For example, Task), you will see a form showing in your tiddler (e.g. completed and completeType field editor), see screenshot below:

The field is only shown if your tiddler already had this field. To edit non-existed field that defined by SuperTag, click " â‰¡ properties" button to expand the available field editor list:
