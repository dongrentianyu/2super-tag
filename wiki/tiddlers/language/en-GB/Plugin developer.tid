[[Suggestion for all Plugin developers about field name: Letâ€™s use Ontology to maintain Interoperability - talk.tiddlywiki.org|https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/suggestion-for-all-plugin-developers-about-field-name-lets-use-ontology-to-maintain-interoperability/1923]]

If you are creating a plugin that heavily make use of tiddler fields, You'd better search for existed supertag sub-plugins that provides trait tags, or search in [[tiddlywiki forum|https://talk.tiddlywiki.org]] for it.

So you can reuse existed TraitTags. In this way, plugins in our community can work together, make users' tiddlywiki a real unified database.

!!! General propose JSON Form Editor

See [[WidgetExamples]] or [[Examples]].

This is only provided as a tool for plugin developers to build custom forms.

For interoperability consideration, it is better to use the TraitTag approach described above, so our TiddlyWiki developer community can have a consistent way to deliver form to end users.
